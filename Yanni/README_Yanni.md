## Project Overview

This project investigates how hydrogeological structure governs spatiotemporal variability in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in a subarctic river-valley aquifer system.

The study integrates:
- Geological modelling
- Hydrochemical datasets
- Stable isotope analysis
- Multivariate statistics (PCA, HCA)
## Problem Statement

Groundwater–surface water interactions play a critical role in regulating carbon storage and transformation in boreal systems. However, subsurface carbon processes remain poorly constrained, especially regarding how hydrostratigraphy and recharge dynamics influence DOC–DIC partitioning.
## Research Questions

1. Does hydrostratigraphy control groundwater carbon speciation and redox evolution?
2. Does shallow groundwater act as a transient DOC conduit during recharge?
3. Does deeper groundwater function as a DIC reservoir under long residence times?
4. Does the aquifer alternate between carbon sink and source across hydrological phases?
## Data Sources

- Groundwater wells (GW1–GW9; A- and B-screens)
- Surface waters (Oulankajoki River; Kourulampi Pond)
- Stable isotopes (δ¹⁸O, δ²H)
- Hydrochemical parameters (DOC, DIC, EC, pH, major ions, Fe, Mn)
- Geological logs and 3D hydrostratigraphic models

Sampling campaigns: 2022–2025
## Methods

1. Geological modelling
2. Seasonal hydrochemical sampling
3. Stable isotope analysis (CRDS)
4. Data preprocessing (DL handling, log transformation, Z-score standardisation)
5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
6. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
7. Cross-correlation analysis
8. Conceptual model development
## Summary of Results

- Groundwater is DOC-poor and DIC-rich relative to surface waters.
- PCA distinguishes recharge-dominated shallow groundwater from carbonate-buffered deep groundwater.
- Floodplain zones act as hotspots of GW–SW carbon transformation.
- Vertical decoupling between transient DOC inputs and persistent DIC storage is observed.
- The aquifer alternates between acting as a carbon sink and source across hydrological phases.
